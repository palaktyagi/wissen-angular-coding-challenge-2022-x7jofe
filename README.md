1. As of now, the login API is not returning the user details (https://reqres.in/) thus I'm not showing the currently logged in user.

2. https://reqres.in/api/unknown -> this API provides a list of resources but the problem statement mentioned to list the users. Therefore, I'm using https://reqres.in/api/users to get the list of the users (Authorization token is appended in the API reqest)
